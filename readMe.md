## General info
This simple and intuitive script allows you to use the **3D bin-packing simulation** in an easier way.
By writing the right keyword you can launch a certain action (like _create bin, add item, pack items_,..).
You can find the algorithm and objects (_Bin, Item, Item_List_) in __3dbp.py_, 
run _text_based_script.py_ for a simple **terminal UI** and 
check _examples_ directory if you want to see some examples about how can you use the code in your projects.
#### Graphic version
Also, I developed a graphic version of **3D bin-packing** that uses the algorithm mentioned above. Link: [3D Bin Packing Graphic Version](https://github.com/DragosCosmin2000/3D-Bin-Packing-Graphic-Version)
